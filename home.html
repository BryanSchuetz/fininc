tagline: Only 19% of Haitian’s have a bank account.
intro: |
  The Haiti Finance Inclusive (FinInc) project tackles enabling environment and market coordination issues to increase financial inclusion in a way that creates lasting benefits for low-income people across Haiti. By accessing basic, more formal financial services, low-income people are able to accumulate assets, withstand financial shocks, invest in businesses, and more conveniently receive and send money and make payments.

    <h2>Sample Activities</h2>
    <p class="usa-font-lead">Only 9% of Haitian adults save money and only 5% borrow from a financial institution. These figures are among the lowest not just in the Latin American and Caribbean region, but globally.</p>
    <p class="usa-font-lead">Here’s how we’re starting to address the issue:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>FinInc is developing a private sector financial inclusion platform, and strengthen existing financial sector associations: Association National des Institutions de Microfinance d’Haïti (ANIMH) and Association Nationale des Caisses Populaires Haïtiennes (ANACAPH).</li>
      <li>We’re increasing information and research activities to enhance understanding of key low-income market segments and gender aspects of financial inclusion to encourage the development of relevant products and services that correspond to livelihoods strategies of low-income market segments.</li>
      <li>We support the development of an active consumer protection environment to ensure that low-income Haitians understand the financial products offered to them and to improve uptake of available services, particularly digital financial services.</li>
